#Session 17: Assignment 1
#Problem Statement 1:
Blood glucose levels for obese patients have a mean of 100 with a standard deviation of
15. A researcher thinks that a diet high in raw cornstarch will have a positive effect on
blood glucose levels. A sample of 36 patients who have tried the raw cornstarch diet
have a mean glucose level of 108. Test the hypothesis that the raw cornstarch had an
effect or not.

#Solution:

Step 1: State the null hypothesis: H0:μ=100
Step 2: State the alternate hypothesis: H1:≠100
Step 3: State your alpha level. We’ll use 0.05 for this example. As this is a two-tailed test, split the alpha into two.
0.05/2=0.025
Step 4: Find the z-score associated with your alpha level. 
You’re looking for the area in one tail only. A z-score for 0.75(1-0.025=0.975) is 1.96. 
As this is a two-tailed test, you would also be considering the left tail (z=1.96)
Step 5: Find the test statistic using this formula: z score formula
z=(108-100)/(15/√30)=2.92.
Step 6: The result in Step 5 is less than -1.96 or greater than 1.96 (Step 3), reject the null hypothesis. 
In this case, it is greater, so you can reject the null.

#Problem Statement 2:
In one state, 52% of the voters are Republicans, and 48% are Democrats. In a second
state, 47% of the voters are Republicans, and 53% are Democrats. Suppose a simple
random sample of 100 voters are surveyed from each state.
What is the probability that the survey will show a greater percentage of Republican
voters in the second state than in the first state?

#Solution:
Let 

P1 = the proportion of Republican voters in the first state, 
P2 = the proportion of Republican voters in the second state, 
p1 = the proportion of Republican voters in the sample from the first state, 
p2 = the proportion of Republican voters in the sample from the second state. 

The number of voters sampled from the first state (n1) = 100, and the number of voters sampled from the second state (n2) = 100.
Make sure the samples from each population are big enough to model differences with a normal distribution. 
Because 
n1P1 = 100 * 0.52 = 52, n1(1 - P1) = 100 * 0.48 = 48, 
n2P2 = 100 * 0.47 = 47, and n2(1 - P2) = 100 * 0.53 = 53 
each are greater than 10, the sample size is large enough.

Find the mean of the difference in sample proportions: E(p1 - p2) = P1 - P2 = 0.52 - 0.47 = 0.05.

Find the standard deviation of the difference:

σd = sqrt{ [ P1(1 - P1) / n1 ] + [ P2(1 - P2) / n2 ] }
σd = sqrt{ [ (0.52)(0.48) / 100 ] + [ (0.47)(0.53) / 100 ] }
σd = sqrt (0.002496 + 0.002491) = sqrt(0.004987) = 0.0706

Find the probability. This problem requires us to find the probability that p1 is less than p2. 
This is equivalent to finding the probability that p1 - p2 is less than zero. 
To find this probability, we need to transform the random variable (p1 - p2) into a z-score. 

That transformation appears below.
zp1 - p2 = (x - μp1 - p2) / σd = = (0 - 0.05)/0.0706 = -0.7082

Using Normal Distribution Calculator, we find 

P(z <=0.7082) = 0.24

the probability of a z-score being -0.7082 or less is 0.24

Therefore, the probability that the survey will show a greater percentage of Republican voters in the second state than in the first state is 0.24.

#Problem Statement 3:
You take the SAT and score 1100. The mean score for the SAT is 1026 and the standard
deviation is 209. How well did you score on the test compared to the average test taker?

#Solution

Step 1: find given values for variables 
X= 1100 ,μ=1026 and σ=209

Step 2: CALCULATE  Z SCORE using formula z = (x – μ) / σ

(1100 – 1026) / 209 = 0.354 

The question was , How well did you score on the test compared to the average test taker ? the answer is 0.354 because your score was 0.354 std devs above the mean.
