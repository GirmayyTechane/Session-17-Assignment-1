#Session 17: Assignment 1
#Problem Statement 1:
Blood glucose levels for obese patients have a mean of 100 with a standard deviation of
15. A researcher thinks that a diet high in raw cornstarch will have a positive effect on
blood glucose levels. A sample of 36 patients who have tried the raw cornstarch diet
have a mean glucose level of 108. Test the hypothesis that the raw cornstarch had an
effect or not.

#Solution:

Step 1: State the null hypothesis: H0:μ=100
Step 2: State the alternate hypothesis: H1:≠100
Step 3: State your alpha level. We’ll use 0.05 for this example. As this is a two-tailed test, split the alpha into two.
0.05/2=0.025
Step 4: Find the z-score associated with your alpha level. 
You’re looking for the area in one tail only. A z-score for 0.75(1-0.025=0.975) is 1.96. 
As this is a two-tailed test, you would also be considering the left tail (z=1.96)
Step 5: Find the test statistic using this formula: z score formula
z=(108-100)/(15/√30)=2.92.
Step 6: The result in Step 5 is less than -1.96 or greater than 1.96 (Step 3), reject the null hypothesis. 
In this case, it is greater, so you can reject the null.
